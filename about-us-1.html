								Company plans to recruit. Once the contract between the

								Company charges the service fee to the Employing Company by the
								quantity of labor recruited at the pre-determined rate per
								capita per month designated in the contract between the Company
								and the Employing Companies. The Company considers that the
								customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefit in the

							Companies and HR Service Companies are both confidential to each

							provided by us (and directly with the HR Service Companies, and HR
							Service Companies are not allowed to contact the Employing
							Companies). The Employing Companies directly submit recruitment
							requests to the Company for their recruitment needs, which
							typically include the number of blue-collar workers needed, work
							hours, the preferred and required skill sets, etc. (the “Overall
							Work Arrangement”). <br />Once the overall work arrangement is
							established, the Company confirms the information regarding
							employment needs of the Employing Company. Subsequently, the
							Company negotiates with the labor service company to organize
							blue-collar workers. The labor service companies provide
							information of the workers and registers basic personal
							information of the workers for the Company. During the execution
							of the contract between the Company and the Employing Companies,
							the Company regularly communicates with the Employing Company to
							resolve issues and collect feedback on the performance of the
							blue-collar workers. The Company is responsible for briefing the
							workers for the Employing Companies’ culture, rules and
							regulations, worker’s job responsibilities, code of conduct, and
							provides short term vocation training if needed. The Company
							considers that the customers simultaneously receive and consume
							the benefit in the service period designated by the contract term
							and the Company recognizes the revenue over time since such
							blue-collar labor started to work for the Employing
							Companies.</span

						Customers. The Company is responsible for the payment of wages to
						the dispatched workers, and charges service fee to the Customers
						based upon the total number of working hours of the dispatched
						employees of the Company. The Company considers that the Customers
						simultaneously receive and consume the benefit as well as the
						dispatch services. The Company controls the specified service before
						that service is performed for a customer. Due to the negative gross
						profit of labor dispatching service, we determined not to expand
						this business line but strategically reduce the labor dispatching
						service.<br />As of June 30, 2023, Gongwuyuan has cooperated and
						partnered with 15 corporate clients, including 7 agency recruitment
						clients, 8 outsourcing business clients, in core manufacturing
						regions such as the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta
						regions. As of June 30, 2023, there are over 4,992 labor companies
						and 3,142 enterprises registered on the Gongwuyuan Platform.
						Gongwuyuan believes that it will be able to convert 10% of such
						potential customers in the future, which will increase the number of
						clients that it cooperates and partners with by over 700.</span
